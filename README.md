Project Overview

This project was conducted under the supervision of Professor Dr. Vinícius Abreu from the Federal University of Pará (UFPA), with contributions from postgraduate student Reno Nooblath from the Computer Science program (UFPA), student Daniel Gomes from the Information Systems course (UFPA), and Professor Dr. Sintia Almeida from the Evandro Chagas Institute (IEC).

Abstract

This study aims to investigate the biological diversity of 21 Cylindrospermopsis genomes and 6 Sphaerospermopsis genomes belonging to the family Aphanizomenonaceae using bioinformatics methods in comparative genomics. The comparative analysis of the lineages from the Americas, Non-Americas, and Sphaerospermopsis revealed a conserved central genome but with distinct accessory genomes by geographic region. The observed variations in the organization of saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin genes in the accessory genome of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii from the Americas and Non-Americas suggest the potential formation of a new taxonomic group due to independent evolutionary trajectories.
