This study aims to investigate the biological diversity of 21 genomes of Cylindrospermopsis and 6 genomes of Sphaerospermopsis belonging to the Aphanizomenonaceae family using bioinformatics methods in comparative genomics. The comparative analysis of strains from the Americas, Non-Americas, and Sphaerospermopsis groups revealed a conserved central genome but with different accessory genomes across geographical regions. The observed variations in the organization of saxitoxin and cylindrospermopsin genes in the accessory genome of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii from the Americas and Non-Americas suggest the potential formation of a new taxonomic group in the future, due to independent evolutionary paths.
